Max Kuhn builds both of these packages. Like mlr was refactored into mlr3, caret was refactored into tidymodels. Since caret has been around for a long time, and there are numerous resources, answers, and solutions to all the possible questions. On the other hand, tidymodels is newer and is built on the tidyverse principles. RStudio hired Max intending to design a tidy version of the caret. Because tidymodels follows the tidyverse principles, its more unified and follows familiar patterns (utilizing pipes for example)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Caret is a single package with various functions for machine learning. For example, createDataPartition for splitting data and trainControl for setting up cross-validation.\nTidymodels is a collection of packages for modelling. It is currently being designed to be decoupled into several packages and the key steps for modelling are currently implemented. This offers greater flexibility for defining models. However, even if it is more readeble and familior to tidyverse users, it may become difficult to remember the workflow or stay at the track when building the model since it has a couple of packages.
